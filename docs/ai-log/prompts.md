# AI Prompt Log

Chronological log of the prompts used to build this project with Claude (agentic coding). It backs the "GenAI tools" part of the presentation: what was asked, what came back, and what was accepted, changed or rejected.

## 001 — Planning, repository structure, first TDD cycle (Sat 17 Oct 2026)

**Context given before the prompt:** the exercise PDF, and a short discussion that settled the stack (Testcontainers instead of H2, Caffeine for caching, TanStack Query for server state).

**Prompt (translated from Russian):**

> Create the plan and the repository structure for:
>
> - Backend: Java 21, Spring Boot 3, PostgreSQL. Testcontainers for tests, plus JWT, Caffeine cache and Flyway.
> - Frontend: React, TypeScript and Vite, data via TanStack Query.
> - Run: `docker-compose` starts the DB, API and frontend with one command. Seed data: a demo user and a batch of Pokémon.
> - GenAI part: a separate `genai/` folder with the prompt, the code and the analysis.
>
> After the plan, run the first TDD cycle on US01.
>
> Also add a breakdown into simple tasks for subagents; I will launch them after the skeleton.

**Output:** `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, backend skeleton, US01 tests and implementation.

**Review notes:**

- Checked that `domain` and `application` have no Spring imports; added an ArchUnit test so this is enforced, not just promised.
- PokeAPI "category" is not on the Pokémon resource: it is the English `genus` of the species. The species is resolved through the `species` link, because form names such as `deoxys-normal` are not valid species names.
- `@Cacheable` does not work on self-invocation, so the HTTP client (cached) and the mapping adapter (parallel fan-out) are separate beans.
- Page size is capped at 50 to protect the upstream API; covered by unit and web tests.
